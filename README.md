## Tips
Here are some tips of mine that might help you
- When I read such kind of books, I always take notes and work with the book instead of just consuming it.
  - What is the message of the book?
  - What are the basic ideas?
  - Has the book revealed blind spots?
  - What are missing skills I need to learn to apply the described points?
- Books that have given me a lot of knowledge, I like to read several times: 
  - The first time for learning the basics about the topic to build a solid foundation.
  - Each further time, to compare my knowledge, skills and experiences in order to grow at a specific topic.
  - Are there lacks of understanding? Do or can I already apply the topics? What are missing skills I need to develop? 
- When applying the content, be careful which culture (country, company, life style, etc.) the author comes from.
  - Sometimes the author has views or approaches that may work differently in your culture for moving forward.
  - Check whether the content works for you or not. If it's doesn't work, it's maybe a cultural problem and some modifications are necessary.
