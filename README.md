### Notes for Reading

If you are a beginner, the following section shows briefly some tips that support reading.

- Take notes to summarize (for quick look-up later) and think about the most important content.

- Work with the books instead of just consuming them. *"Working with a book"* means to become clear about the core ideas/principles and (how to) implement them in daily life - Proactively gain necessary knowledge and skills.

- Read (good) books multiple times. One characteristic of good books is that they provide new and deeper insights after being read more than once. The first reading should be used to build a foundation. All further times to strengthen the foundation and go deeper into the topic. However, there should be at least a couple of months between repetitions in order to process the knowledge and to gain new experience.

- Change and progress take time - Don't force it. Especially in the beginning, it's a sneaky trap to overload oneself by taking too much in too short a time. Therefore, it's important to find the balance between needed effort and breaks to relax. Also, consider the author's culture and context - Maybe things works different. In most cases, the content must be adapted to the current one.

- *"To really understand the content"* means to be able to apply it and producing meaningful results - No smoke and mirrors. Building skills often take years.

- Talk to other people with similar opinions about the topics, but don't be disappointed if they disagree. A good discussion can provide new views.
