# Booklist

This page contains a list of books that I have read and can recommend to others. The list covers topics like personal development, self improvement on the on side and (self) management as well as entrepreneurship on the other one. For both areas I have named a personal top 3 for each, in case you are undecided where you can best start. All other entries follow in alphabetical order. You don't have to read the books in the listed order - feel completely free to choose.

## Tips
Here are some tips of mine that might help you
- When I read such kind of books, I always take notes and work with the book instead of just consuming it.
  - What is the message of the book?
  - What are the basic ideas?
  - Has the book revealed blind spots?
  - What are missing skills I need to learn to apply the described points?
- Books that have given me a lot of knowledge, I like to read several times: 
  - The first time for learning the basics about the topic to build a solid foundation.
  - Each further time, to compare my knowledge, skills and experiences in order to grow at a specific topic.
  - Are there lacks of understanding? Do or can I already apply the topics? What are missing skills I need to develop? 
- When applying the content, be careful which culture (country, company, life style, etc.) the author comes from.
  - Sometimes the author has views or approaches that may work differently in your culture for moving forward.
  - Check whether the content works for you or not. If it's doesn't work, it's maybe a cultural problem and some modifications are necessary.
