## Tips
Here are some tips of mine that might help you
- When I read such kind of books, I always take notes and work with the book instead of just consuming it.
  - What is the message or basic idea of the book?
  - Has the book revealed blind spots?
- Books that have given me a lot of knowledge, I like to read several times: 
  - The first time to learn about the topic.
  - Each further time, to compare my knowledge, skills and experiences.
  - Are there lacks of understanding? Can I already apply the topics? What are missing skills? 
- When applying the contents, be careful which culture (country, company, life style, etc.) the author comes from.
  - Sometimes the author has views or approaches that may work slightly differently in your culture to help you move forward.
  - If sometimes it doesn't work, it can also be a cultural problem.
