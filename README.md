### Notes for Reading

The following section shows briefly some tips to support reading.

- Work with a book instead of just consuming it. *"Working with a book"* means to become clear about the core ideas/principles and how to implement them in daily life.

- Take notes to summarize the content (also for later look-up quickly) and think about the most important points.

- *"To become clear about the content"* means to be able to apply the topics in real world producing meaningful results - No smoke and mirrors. Building skills often take months or even years.

- Read good books multiple times. Good books provide new and deeper insights after being read more than once. The first reading should be used to build a foundation. All further times to strengthen the foundation and go deeper into the topic. However, there should be at least a couple of months between repetitions in order to process the knowledge.

- The learning process takes time - Don't rush things or force them. Especially in the beginning, it's a sneaky trap to overload oneself by taking too much in too short a time. Therefore, it's important to find the balance between required effort and breaks to relax.

- Consider the author's culture and context. Maybe things works different within your circumstances and must be adapted.

- Talk to other people with similar opinions about the topics, but don't be disappointed if they disagree. A good discussion can provide new perspectives.
